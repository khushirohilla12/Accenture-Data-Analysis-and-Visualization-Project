## Client Overview:

- **Client Name:** Social Buzz
- **Industry:** Social media & content creation
- **Established:** 2010
- **HQ Location:** San Francisco
- **Number of Employees:** 250

## Project Details

- Conducted an audit of Social Buzz's big data practice.
- Provided recommendations for a successful IPO.
- Analyzed content categories to highlight the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

## Task 1: Project Understanding
**A Data Analyst sits between the Business and the Data**
 - One of Accenture‚Äôs Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.
- She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.
- Mae has scheduled a project kick-off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning. 
- About Client: [Social Buzz](https://github.com/khushirohilla12/Accenture-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Project/blob/main/Data_Analytics%20Client%20Brief.pdf)


**Task for Accenture :**

- Client's Problem that Accenture is tasked to address: The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it.
- Three requirements that Accenture is tasked to fulfill: Audit of big data practice, recommendations for IPO, analysis of popular content


**Task for Data Analyst :**

Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.

In short, the client wanted to see **‚ÄúAn analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity‚Äù.**


## Task 2: Data Cleaning and Modelling

- Often you won‚Äôt need all these datasets to find what you‚Äôre looking for.
- So, the first step is to use this [data model](https://github.com/khushirohilla12/Accenture-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Project/blob/main/Data%20model.pdf) to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
- After Analysis we got data sets needed to complete analysis:
```
- Reaction Score(score is used to quantified the popularity)
- Content ID
- Reaction Types
- Content type
- Category 
```
### Data Cleaning:
Clean the data by:
- removing rows that have values that are missing,
- changing the data type of some values within a column, and
- removing columns that are not relevant to this task.
- Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you‚Äôre investigating. If you can‚Äôt think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

**End result will be a cleaned data set**

### Data Modelling:
**Create a final data set by merging 3 tables End result will be one spreadsheet**

- A cleaned dataset
- Top 5 categories

### Cleaned Data set:
So, the cleaned data set after data modelling & data cleaning : [Cleaned Dataset](https://github.com/khushirohilla12/Accenture-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Project/blob/main/Content%20-%20Reaction%20Type%20-%20Reaction.csv)

## Task 3: Data Visualization and Storytelling
Make the PowerPoint presentation as per the given template

- Powerpoint Presentation : [PPT](https://github.com/khushirohilla12/Accenture-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Project/blob/main/Data%20Analytics%20final%20ppt.pptx)

## Task 4: Preasent to the Client
